# **The Challenge** ðŸ’ª

Buena rents to a selected group of tenants. The aim of this challenge is to build an application form for tenants, so that they can register with Buena and start booking apartments. 

We're looking for a multi-page application form, which should include:

    - email
    - phone number
    - salary indication (radio buttons)
        - 0 - 1.000
        - 1.000 - 2.000
        - 2.000 - 3.000
        - 3.000 - 4.000
        - Mehr als 4.000
- a progress indicator
- a summary of all the data entered during the flow, displayed on the last page.
