## Getting Started
### Install

You can use any Package Manager you want. I used Yarn:

```
yarn install
```

### Start the server

You can either run it in Dev mode:

```
yarn run dev
```

Or build and start the application

```
yarn build && yarn start
```

## **The Challenge** ðŸ’ª

Buena rents to a selected group of tenants. The aim of this challenge is to build an application form for tenants, so that they can register with Buena and start booking apartments.

We're looking for a multi-page application form, which should include:

- fields, including:
  - full name
  - email
  - phone number
  - salary indication (radio buttons)
    - 0 - 1.000
    - 1.000 - 2.000
    - 2.000 - 3.000
    - 3.000 - 4.000
    - Mehr als 4.000
- a progress indicator
- a summary of all the data entered during the flow, displayed on the last page.

Stretch goals to show off can include ðŸ˜Ž:

- Animations
- Responsive design
- A neat design ðŸŽ¨
- State storage
- Automated tests
